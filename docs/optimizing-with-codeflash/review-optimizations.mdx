# Staging Review for Optimizations

<Note>
  This is a Pro feature available exclusively to Codeflash Pro users. [Upgrade to
  Pro](https://app.codeflash.ai/billing) to access it.
</Note>
Staging Review allows you to preview and evaluate all optimizations before creating pull requests. This
feature provides a centralized review interface where you can examine proposed changes and selectively
create pull requests for approved optimizations.

## Benefits of Staging Review

- **Preview without PRs:** Review all optimization suggestions without cluttering your repository with multiple pull requests
- **Batch review:** Examine all optimizations in one centralized location
- **Selective PR creation:** Choose which optimizations to convert into pull requests
- **Reduced noise:** Keep your repository's PR list clean while evaluating changes

## Using Staging Review

To optimize your codebase with staging review enabled, run:

```bash
codeflash --all --staging-review
```

This command will:


1. Start to optimize your project, and if it finds any optimizations, it will save them to [Review Optimizations Page](https://app.codeflash.ai/review-optimizations) instead of creating PRs immediately

2. Provide you with a staging interface to review all proposed changes

## Managing Staged Optimizations

Once optimizations are staged, you can:
- Review each optimization individually
- Compare original and optimized code side-by-side
- Create pull requests for selected optimizations directly from the staging interface
- Edit the code of staged optimizations
