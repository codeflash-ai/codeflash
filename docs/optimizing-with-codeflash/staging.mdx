# Staging Review for Optimizations

<Note>This is a Pro feature available exclusively to Codeflash Pro users.</Note>

Staging Review allows you to preview and evaluate all optimizations before creating pull requests. This feature provides a centralized review interface where you can examine proposed changes and selectively create pull requests for approved optimizations.

## Benefits of Staging Review

- **Preview without PRs:** Review all optimization suggestions without cluttering your repository with multiple pull requests
- **Batch review:** Examine all optimizations in one centralized location
- **Selective PR creation:** Choose which optimizations to convert into pull requests
- **Reduced noise:** Keep your repository's PR list clean while evaluating changes

## Using Staging Review

To optimize your codebase with staging review enabled, run:

```bash
codeflash --all --staging-review
```

This command will:

1. Analyze and optimize all functions in your codebase
2. Store the optimizations in a staging area instead of creating PRs immediately
3. Provide you with a staging interface to review all proposed changes

## Managing Staged Optimizations

Once optimizations are staged, you can:

- Review each optimization individually
- Compare original and optimized code side-by-side
- Create pull requests for selected optimizations directly from the staging interface

## Requirements

- Codeflash Pro subscription
- Codeflash GitHub App installed in your repository
- Latest version of the Codeflash CLI
