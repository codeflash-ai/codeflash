{/* TODO: Add more pictures to guide better */}

Codeflash can automatically optimize your code when new pull requests are opened.

To be able to scan new code for performance optimizations, Codeflash requires a GitHub action workflow to 
be installed which runs the Codeflash optimization logic on every new pull request.
If the action workflow finds an optimization, it communicates with the Codeflash GitHub 
App through our secure servers and asks it to suggest new changes to the pull request.

This is the most useful way of using Codeflash, where you set it up once and all your new code gets optimized.
So setting this up is highly recommended.

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
**Before you begin, make sure you have:**

âœ… A Codeflash API key from the [Codeflash Web App](https://app.codeflash.ai/)

âœ… Completed [local installation](/getting-started/local-installation) with `codeflash init`

âœ… A Python project with a configured `pyproject.toml` file
</Warning>

## Setup Options

<Tab title="Automated Setup (Recommended)">
<Steps>
<Step title="Run the Setup Command">
```bash
codeflash init-actions
```
This command will automatically create the GitHub Actions workflow file and guide you through the setup process.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Setup">
Open a new pull request to your GitHub project. You'll see:
- âœ… A new Codeflash workflow running in GitHub Actions
- ðŸ¤– The codeflash-ai bot commenting with optimization suggestions (if any are found)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Recommended approach** - This automated setup ensures you get the latest workflow configuration with all best practices included.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Workflow File">
Create `.github/workflows/codeflash-optimize.yaml` in your repository:


```yaml title=".github/workflows/codeflash-optimize.yaml"
name: Codeflash

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  optimize:
    name: Optimize new code in this PR
    if: ${{ github.actor != 'codeflash-ai[bot]' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CODEFLASH_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CODEFLASH_API_KEY }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      # TODO: Replace the following with your project's Python installation method
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      # TODO: Replace the following with your project's dependency installation method
      - name: Install Project Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        # TODO: Replace the following with your project setup method
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install codeflash
      - name: Run Codeflash to optimize code
        id: optimize_code
        run: |
          codeflash
```

<Warning>
**Replace the TODOs** in the workflow file above with your project's specific setup commands.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Your Package Manager">
Customize the dependency installation based on your Python package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Poetry
- name: Install Project Dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install poetry
    poetry install --with dev
- name: Run Codeflash to optimize code
  run: |
    poetry env use python 
    poetry run codeflash
```

```yaml uv
- uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
  with:
    enable-cache: true
- run: uv sync --group=dev
- name: Run Codeflash to optimize code
  run: uv run codeflash
```

```yaml pip
- name: Install Project Dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install codeflash
- name: Run Codeflash to optimize code
  run: codeflash
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Repository Secret">
1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to **Secrets and Variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add:
   - **Name**: `CODEFLASH_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your API key from [app.codeflash.ai/app/apikeys](https://app.codeflash.ai/app/apikeys)

<Tip>
**Security Note**: Never commit your API key directly to your code. Always use GitHub repository secrets.
