Codeflash is installed and configured on a per-project basis.

You can install Codeflash locally for a project by running the following command in the project's virtual environment:

### Prerequisites

Before installing Codeflash, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.9 or above** installed
2. **A Python project** with a virtual environment
3. **Project dependencies installed** in your virtual environment
4. **Tests** (optional) for your code (Codeflash uses tests to verify optimizations)

<Warning>
**Virtual Environment Required**

Always install Codeflash in your project's virtual environment, not globally. Make sure your virtual environment is activated before proceeding.

```bash
# Example: Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
#venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
</Warning>
<Steps>
<Step title="Install Codeflash">
```bash
pip install codeflash
```

<Tip>
**Codeflash is a Development Dependency**

We recommend installing Codeflash as a development dependency.
It doesn't need to be installed as part of your package requirements. 
Codeflash is intended to be used locally and as part of development workflows such as CI.

<CodeGroup>
```toml Poetry
[tool.poetry.dependencies.dev]
codeflash = "^latest"
```

```bash uv
uv add --dev codeflash
```

```bash pip
pip install --dev codeflash
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Generate a Codeflash API Key">
Codeflash uses cloud-hosted AI models to optimize your code. You'll need an API key to use it.

1. Visit the [Codeflash Web App](https://app.codeflash.ai/) 
2. Sign up with your GitHub account (free)
3. Navigate to the [API Key](https://app.codeflash.ai/app/apikeys) page to generate your API key

<Note>
**Free Tier Available**

Codeflash offers a **free tier** with a limited number of optimizations per month. Perfect for trying it out or small projects!
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Run Automatic Configuration">
Navigate to your project's root directory (where your `pyproject.toml` file is or should be) and run:

```bash
# Make sure you're in your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run the initialization
codeflash init
```

If you don't have a pyproject.toml file yet, the codeflash init command will ask you to create one

<Info>
**What's pyproject.toml?**

`pyproject.toml` is a configuration file that is used to specify build tool settings for Python projects. 
pyproject.toml is the modern replacement for setup.py and requirements.txt files.
It's the new standard for Python package metadata.
</Info>

When running `codeflash init`, you will see the following prompts:

```text
1. Enter your Codeflash API key: 
2. Which Python module do you want me to optimize going forward? (e.g. my_module)
3. Where are your tests located? (e.g. tests/)
4. Which test framework do you use? (pytest/unittest)
```
</Step>
</Steps>

After you have answered these questions, Codeflash will be configured for your project.
The configuration will be saved in the `pyproject.toml` file in the root directory of your project.
To understand the configuration options, and set more advanced options, see the [Configuration](/configuration) page.

### Step 4: Install the Codeflash GitHub App

{/* TODO: Justify to users Why we need the user to install Github App even in local Installation or local optimization? */}
Finally, if you have not done so already, Codeflash will ask you to install the Github App in your repository.  The Codeflash GitHub App allows access to your repository to the codeflash-ai bot to open PRs, review code, and provide optimization suggestions.

Please [install the Codeflash GitHub
app](https://github.com/apps/codeflash-ai/installations/select_target) by choosing the repository you want to install
Codeflash on.

## Try It Out!

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Quick Start">
Once configured, you can start optimizing your code immediately:

```bash
# Optimize a specific function
codeflash --file path/to/your/file.py --function function_name

# Or optimize locally without creating a PR
codeflash --file path/to/your/file.py --function function_name --no-pr
```

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Start with a single function to see how Codeflash works before running it on your entire codebase.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üì¶ Module not found errors">
    Make sure:
    - ‚úÖ Your virtual environment is activated
    - ‚úÖ All project dependencies are installed
    
    ```bash
    # Verify your virtual environment is active
    which python  # Should show path to your venv
    
    # Install missing dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="üß™ No optimizations found or debugging issues">
    Use the `--verbose` flag for detailed output:
    ```bash
    codeflash optimize --verbose
    ```
    
    This will show:
    - üîç Which functions are being analyzed
    - üö´ Why certain functions were skipped
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Detailed error messages
    - üìä Performance analysis results
    
    <Tip>
    **Common Reasons Functions Are Skipped:**
    - Function is too simple (less than 3 lines)
    - Function has no clear performance bottleneck
    - Function contains unsupported constructs
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="üîç No tests found errors">
    Verify:
    - üìÅ Your test directory path is correct in `pyproject.toml`
    - üîç Tests are discoverable by your test framework
    - üìù Test files follow naming conventions (`test_*.py` for pytest)
    
    ```bash
    # Test if pytest can discover your tests
    pytest --collect-only
    
    # Check your pyproject.toml configuration
    cat pyproject.toml | grep -A 5 "\[tool.codeflash\]"
    ```
