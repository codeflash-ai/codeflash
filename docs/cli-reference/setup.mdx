# Setup Commands

Commands for initializing Codeflash in your project, setting up continuous optimization, and verifying your installation.

---

## `codeflash init`

Initialize Codeflash for your Python project. This creates the configuration in `pyproject.toml`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic
codeflash init
```

```bash With Formatter Override
codeflash init --override-formatter-check
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The `init` command will guide you through an interactive setup process,
  including API key configuration, module selection, and GitHub App
  installation.
</Tip>

**What it does:**

- Prompts for your Python module directory (`module-root`)
- Prompts for your test directory (`tests-root`)
- Configures code formatter preferences
- Sets up telemetry preferences
- Optionally installs the Codeflash VS Code extension
- Optionally sets up GitHub Actions workflow

---

## `codeflash init-actions`

Set up GitHub Actions workflow for continuous optimization on every pull request.

```bash
codeflash init-actions
```

**What it does:**

- Creates a workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
- Opens a PR with the workflow configuration
- Requires the Codeflash GitHub App to be installed

<Warning>
  This command requires the Codeflash GitHub App to be installed on your repository. If you haven't installed it, you'll be prompted with a link to do so.
</Warning>

---

## `codeflash vscode-install`

Install the Codeflash extension for VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.

```bash
codeflash vscode-install
```

**What it does:**

- Detects which editor you're using (VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf)
- Downloads and installs the appropriate extension
- Works with both Marketplace and Open VSX sources

<Tip>
  This command is also run automatically during `codeflash init` if you choose to install the extension.
</Tip>

---

## `codeflash --verify-setup`

Verify your Codeflash installation by running a sample optimization.

```bash
codeflash --verify-setup
```

**What it does:**

- Creates a temporary demo file
- Runs a sample optimization
- Verifies all components are working correctly
- Cleans up the demo file afterward

<Note>
  This command takes about 3 minutes to complete. It's a great way to ensure everything is set up correctly before optimizing your actual code.
</Note>
