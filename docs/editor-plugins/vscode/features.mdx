# Extension Features

The Codeflash VS Code extension provides a seamless optimization experience with inline suggestions, a dedicated sidebar panel, and multiple ways to select and optimize functions.

---

## Inline Optimization Suggestions (CodeLens)

The extension shows **"optimize"** hints directly above functions that can be optimized:

```python
# optimize ← Click this to start optimization
def process_data(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        if item > 0:
            result.append(item * 2)
    return result
```

**How it works:**

1. Open any Python file in your project
2. The extension analyzes your code automatically
3. Functions that can be optimized show an "optimize" hint above them
![CodeLens hint above function](../../images/CodeLens.png)
4. Click the hint to start optimization

<Tip>
  Look for CodeLens hints above functions in your editor for quick optimization
  access.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Functions must be inside your configured `module-root` directory to show
  optimization hints. Check your `pyproject.toml` if hints aren't appearing.
</Warning>

## Sidebar Panel Overview

Access the Codeflash sidebar by clicking the Codeflash icon in the Activity Bar (left side of your editor).

The sidebar has two main tabs:

- **Optimization** — Select files and functions to optimize, or use quick actions
- **Tasks** — View and manage your optimization queue and completed optimizations

---

## Optimization Tab

The **Optimization** tab is your main interface for selecting code to optimize. It provides several ways to start optimizing:

### File and Function Selection

![Optimization tab with file and function selectors](../../images/optimization-tab.png)

At the top of the Optimization tab, you'll find:

1. **FILE** — pick a Python file from your workspace.
2. **FUNCTION/METHOD** — pick a specific function or method in that file.
3. **Optimize** — click the lightning button to queue that function for optimization.

<Info>
  **Qualified Names** — Functions are displayed with their fully qualified
  names, making it easy to identify the exact function you want to optimize,
  including class methods and nested functions.
</Info>

### Quick Action Cards

Below the file/function selectors, you'll find two action cards for common optimization workflows:

#### Optimize Current File

- **Icon:** Lightning bolt
![Optimize current file quick action card](../../images/Optimize-current-file.png)
- **Action:** Analyze and optimize all functions in the currently opened file
- **How to use:** Click the card to optimize all functions in the active editor tab

<Warning>
  Optimizing all functions in a large file may take time. The extension will
  show you the count of functions and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
</Warning>

#### Optimize Changed Code

- **Icon:** Git diff symbol (intertwined links)
![Optimize Changed Code quick action card](../../images/optimize-code-diff.png)
- **Action:** Optimize functions in your Git diff
- **How to use:** Click the card to automatically detect and optimize all modified functions in your current Git changes

<Tip>
  This is perfect for optimizing code you've just changed before committing. The
  extension will only optimize functions that are part of your current changes.
</Tip>

### Getting Started Section

When you first open the Optimization tab, you'll see a "Ready to Optimize" section with:

- A brief description: "AI-powered Python optimization with automatic testing & benchmarking"
- A **View Documentation** button to access help and guides

---

## Tasks Tab and reviewing optimizations

The **Tasks** tab shows your optimization queue and completed optimizations. You can:

- See which functions are queued or running
- Inspect completed optimizations, including speedup and quality
- Open the related PR (when the optimization was created via PR)

Click **View Optimization** on any completed item to see the diff and explanation, then apply or reject the changes.  
You will also see inline comments on optimized functions in the editor with actions to **View Patch**, **Accept**, or **Reject**.
