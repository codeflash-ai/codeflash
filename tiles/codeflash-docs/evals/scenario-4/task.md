# Design a Candidate Selection Dashboard

## Context

The codeflash team wants to build a dashboard that shows users how optimization candidates were evaluated and why a particular candidate won. The dashboard needs to display the selection process at each stage, from initial candidate pool through to the final winner.

## Task

Write a specification document for the dashboard that explains:
1. How many candidates are generated at each effort level
2. The exact criteria and order of operations used to pick the winning candidate
3. How refinement candidates are ranked differently from initial candidates

Include concrete examples showing how two hypothetical candidates would be compared.

## Expected Outputs

- A markdown file `selection-dashboard-spec.md`
