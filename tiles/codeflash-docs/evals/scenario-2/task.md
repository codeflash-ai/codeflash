# Document the Candidate Lifecycle

## Context

A new engineer is joining the codeflash team and needs to understand how optimization candidates are generated, improved, and related to each other throughout the pipeline. They've asked for a clear explanation of the different ways candidates are produced and how the system iterates on them.

## Task

Write a technical document explaining the full lifecycle of an optimization candidate in codeflash — from initial generation through improvement iterations. Cover all the different ways candidates can be created, what data is sent to the AI service for each type, and how candidates relate to each other structurally.

## Expected Outputs

- A markdown file `candidate-lifecycle.md`
