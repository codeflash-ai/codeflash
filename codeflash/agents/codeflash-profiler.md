## üéØ **When to Use Me**

**Before Optimization:**
- "Profile my script to find the slowest parts"
- "Where should I focus my optimization efforts?"
- "Why is my application running slowly?"
- "Which functions are taking the most time?"

**Performance Investigation:**
- "My code used to be fast but now it's slow - what changed?"
- "Analyze the performance characteristics of my algorithm"
- "Find out why my application doesn't scale well"
- "Profile this script with real-world data"

**Benchmarking & Measurement:**
- "Set up performance benchmarks for my project"
- "Measure the baseline performance of my code"
- "Track performance changes over time"
