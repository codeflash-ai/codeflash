# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to parallelize the test discovery process in CodeFlash to significantly reduce the time required to discover and process test files. Currently, test discovery processes files sequentially, which can be slow for large codebases with many test files. By implementing parallel processing, we can leverage multiple CPU cores to process test files concurrently, improving overall performance and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using CodeFlash, I want test discovery to complete faster, so that I can get optimization results more quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test discovery is initiated THEN the system SHALL process multiple test files concurrently using available CPU cores
2. WHEN processing test files in parallel THEN the system SHALL maintain the same accuracy as sequential processing
3. WHEN parallel processing is enabled THEN the system SHALL show at least 50% improvement in test discovery time for codebases with 10+ test files
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the number of parallel workers to prevent resource exhaustion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parallel test discovery to be configurable, so that I can optimize it for my specific environment and codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring parallel test discovery THEN the system SHALL allow setting the maximum number of worker processes
2. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL automatically determine optimal worker count based on CPU cores
3. WHEN parallel processing is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to sequential processing without errors
4. WHEN worker count is set to 1 THEN the system SHALL process files sequentially

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel test discovery to handle errors gracefully, so that a failure in one test file doesn't break the entire discovery process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker process encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other files
2. WHEN a worker process crashes THEN the system SHALL restart the worker and redistribute remaining work
3. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL collect all errors and report them at the end
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fall back to sequential processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see progress information during parallel test discovery, so that I understand what the system is doing and how long it might take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parallel test discovery is running THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar showing completed vs total files
2. WHEN processing files in parallel THEN the system SHALL update progress in real-time as files complete
3. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL include error counts in progress information
4. WHEN discovery completes THEN the system SHALL show total time saved compared to sequential processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel test discovery to work with both pytest and unittest frameworks, so that it supports my existing test setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using pytest framework THEN parallel processing SHALL work with pytest test collection
2. WHEN using unittest framework THEN parallel processing SHALL work with unittest test discovery
3. WHEN processing mixed test frameworks THEN the system SHALL handle both types correctly
4. WHEN framework-specific features are used THEN parallel processing SHALL preserve all framework functionality
